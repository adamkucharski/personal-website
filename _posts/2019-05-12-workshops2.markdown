Our team at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is launching a new project to study flu transmission in schools and communities, and is looking for schools to partner with.
 
### Background
We are based in the <a href="http://cmmid.lshtm.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases</a>, and study how factors like social behaviour influence infectious disease outbreaks. We have previously run several research projects with schools (see references below). We'd like to develop links with your school to run a survey of flu symptoms in schools and households, working with your students to help them gain deeper insights into scientific research along the way.

### The project
The project would involve running 3 workshops with the same group of students during the 2018/19 school year, each lasting 1–1.5 hours (or as close as your timetable allows). Sessions will be aimed at Year 9 or 10, and tailored to match topics covered in the curriculum.
 
Over the course of the workshops, students will have the opportunity to develop a recruitment strategy for the project, and also analysis the new data once collected. In the process, students will be able to debate and explore topical health issues, covering interdisciplinary topics including public health, statistical analysis, and data ethics. In partnership with your school, we would assess the effectiveness of such activities by measuring students' attitudes and progress before and after the project.
 
If this is something that your school would be interested in please get in touch (adam.kucharski AT lshtm.ac.uk) by 18th June 2019.
