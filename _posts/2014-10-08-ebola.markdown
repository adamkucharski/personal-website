<p> We’ve published a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436514000528" target="_blank">new paper</a> in Epidemics revisiting the first known Ebola outbreak in Zaire in 1976. We show that the person-to-person reproduction number was likely to have been above 1 at the start of the outbreak, and hence the epidemiological conditions present in 1976 could have generated a larger outbreak, purely by chance. This suggests that a large outbreak of Ebola in a community was always possible, given enough time. As my co-authors put it in this Lancet comment piece, “even if we curtail this outbreak, we should expect another major one to occur eventually”. </p>

<p> As part of the research, we digitised the original typewritten case list, taken from Prof Peter Piot’s original field notes. The data – which include date of onset/outcome & source of infection – could prove useful for future Ebola research, so we’ve made them available (and open access) as supplementary information. </p>
