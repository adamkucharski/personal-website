My group at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine is launching a new programme of science workshops about data science and infectious diseases, and are looking for schools to partner with.
 
### Background
We are based in the <a href="http://cmmid.lshtm.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases</a>, and study how factors like social behaviour influence infectious disease outbreaks. We have previously run several research projects with schools (see references below) and are part of the <a href="http://bbc.co.uk/pandemic" target="_blank">BBC Contagion! project</a>, a major national data collection initiative and TV programme. We'd like to develop links with your school to help students gain deeper insights into scientific research, and help us understand how research activities can improve engagement with science, using funding received from the Wellcome Trust.

### The project
We aim to run 3 workshops with the same group of students during the 2018/19 school year, each lasting around 1.5 hours (or as close as your timetable allows). Sessions will be aimed at Year 9 or 10, and tailored to match topics covered in the curriculum. We would then run another set of workshops in the following year, with a new cohort of students.
 
Over the course of the workshops, students will have the opportunity to develop mini-research projects linked to the spread of infection, building on some of the real datasets we have previously collected. In the process, students will be able to debate and explore topical health issues, covering interdisciplinary topics including public health, statistical analysis, and data ethics. In partnership with your school, we would assess the effectiveness of such activities by measuring students' attitudes and progress before and after the project.
 
If this is something that your school would be interested in please get in touch (adam.kucharski AT lshtm.ac.uk) by 14th September 2018.
