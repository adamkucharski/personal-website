<p>We’ve got a <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002082">new paper</a> in PLOS Biology looking at how immunity develops over the course of a lifetime. Immunity against seasonal flu viruses influences a range of important processes, from the emergence of new virus strains, to the size and severity of flu epidemics, to the effectiveness of vaccination programmes. However, there is much we don’t understand about the factors that shape a person’s immune response to a particular strain. The main reason is because individual infections – and the subsequent acquisition of immunity – over the course of a lifetime are rarely observed directly. </p>

<p> To work out how a lifetime of infections affect a person’s level of immunity, we developed a new mathematical model of antibody dynamics. Our model captured the specific strains with which an individual had been infected, as well as the different immunological processes that could influence their antibody response. We then combined the model with data from a survey in southern China that tested against antibody levels against nine different influenza strains from 1968 to 2009. This made it possible to identify key components of the immune response, and estimate  the frequency of influenza infection in different age groups. </p>

<p> This research was covered by several media outlets, including: BBC News, El País, The Independent, New Scientist, The Telegraph, Time, and The Times. </p>
